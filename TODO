* More flexible markup rendering
* Nested layouts
* Better COMMON.rb handling
* Find and Integrate test run / coverage reports
* Ability to have multiple views of a section, e.g. user guide (separate
  pages) and user guide (one page) generated from same source.
* Auto-link within section
* Index and glossary support
* statistics
* (maybe?) Automatic navigation / TOC
* (maybe?) Rant integration
* Ability to define rules for input.ext -> output.ext
* Support ruby source templates (.rbt, auto rename to .rb on output).
