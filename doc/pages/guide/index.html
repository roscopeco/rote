<% @page_title = 'User guide' %>

p{color:red}. *The guide is still under construction*

<a name='top'></a>

It is assumed that you have installed Rote already. If not, please
consult the "README":<%= link_rel '/rdoc/files/README.html' %>
for installation instructions.

<%= section 3, 'Conventions', false %>

*Task names* - Rote's standard tasks are always referred to with the base-name
_doc_ , e.g. @doc_pages@, @doc_clean@, and just plain @doc@. This is the prefix
used by the built-in Rakefile, but since it can be changed when using Rote in
your own Rake builds you should of course substitute whatever is appropriate 
if you have chosen to modify it.

<%= section 3, 'Starting out with Rote' %>

<%= section 4, 'Creating a project', false %>

To get started quickly, we'll use the built-in project template, which provides
a standard Rote directory tree with a single page, and Rakefile ready for
customisation. The template gives a convenient way to get started on a new
Rote project. To invoke it, just type:

<p><pre><code>        rote create someproject</code></pre></p>

If all goes well, you should see a single line (@cp_r ...@) indicating that
Rote copied the template to your specified directory (@someproject@ in this
case). This directory will have the following layout:

<p><code><pre>  
  someproject
  |
  |--> Rakefile
  |
  |--> doc
  |    |--> res
  |    |    |--> images
  |    |    |--> rote-tiny.png
  |    |
  |    |--> layouts
  |    |    |--> normal.thtml
  |    | 
  |    |--> pages
  |         |--> COMMON.rb
  |         |--> index.thtml
  |         |--> index.rb
			  
</pre></code></p>

Template sources under the 'pages' directory may have any extension (except
@rb@), and will be rendered to the same base-name under the output directory,
with their file extension supplied by the original, possible via an 
<%= section_link 'extension_mappings', 'extension mapping' %> 
See the section on Layouts below for details on layout name resolution.

Ruby source is optional, and allows you to define instance variables and 
methods on a Page instance. COMMON.rb is applied to all pages in a given
directory. See <%= section_link 'creating templates', 'the section on templates' %>
for more information on the specifics.

To build the sample page, simply type @rote@ or @rake@ from the top-level
directory. This will start the default @doc@ task to transform all 
modified pages / resources (everything, in this case).

The README included with the project template has further information
about build options and available tasks, as well as pointers to possible
next steps.

<%= section 4, 'From the command-line' %>

If you are generating a standalone documentation set (i.e. not as part of 
some wider build) and you don't want to worry maintaining a @Rakefile@,
you can use the built-in build via the @rote@ command. This works with
the standard directory layout above, and wraps invocation of @rake@ on a
built-in version of the standard Rakefile.

Given the above layout, you can generate the documentation set by running:

<p><pre><code>        rote</code></pre></p>
	
from the top-level directory (@project@ in the example above), you should get
a 'html' directory created with the (transformed) templates, and any 
resources should be copied as necessary. 

Being based on Rake, Rote supports last-modified checking, and provides an
individual file task for each page in your doc set. For example, running 
the 'rote' command again with no options will cause it to exit almost
immediately, since all output is up to date. If you change a file, and run
rote again, then just that file will be updated. Even dependencies that are
determined dynamically (such as layout files) can be tracked for incremental
build purposes.

The file tasks are named for the target files, so for example to generate
just the top-level index.html (regardless of whether it's been modified)
you'd run:

<p><pre><code>        rote html/index.html</code></pre></p>

The @clobber@ task supports deleting all output files to start from scratch:

<p><pre><code>        rote clobber</code></pre></p>

Of course, multiple file or task names (or a mixture) can be specified.
You can get a list of valid tasks in the current context with:

<p><pre><code>        rote --tasks</code></pre></p>
	
Further command-line usage information is available with:
	
<p><pre><code>        rote --usage</code></pre></p>
	
and Unix installations performed with @install.rb@ should also make a
manpage available for the @rote@ command.

<div class='note'>
*Note* That, for most purposes, you should prefer to use a Rakefile based
build, as created by the @rote create@ command. The command-wrapper 
functionality in Rote is maintained only as a quick start option, and
is not guaranteed to remain supported in 1.0. 

If you do choose to use a Rakefile approach, do *not* use the 'rote' 
command to build documentation, since it will ignore your local Rakefile
and can result in inconsistent behaviour.
</div>

<%= section 4, 'From your Rakefile' %>

If you are wanting to build documentation as part of a larger build process, or
commandline setup, then you'll want to get started on integrating Rote with 
your own (existing) @Rakefile@. If you bootstrap a project with the 
@rote create@ command, you'll get a Rakefile which you can modify to suit
your requirements.
	
There is nothing special about this Rakefile, and it can use any of the other
Rake tasks, or indeed any other Ruby code. It is run with a command like:

<pre><code>        rake doc</code></pre>

If all goes well, you should see each command and transformation output to your
console as Rote runs. 

See the main Rote @Rakefile@ for an example of integrating Rote with your 
software project, including linking to Rdoc generation and so on. The
<%= section_link 'Rake task configuration' %> section has more information
on the options supported by Rote's task library.

<%= section 3, 'Creating templates' %>

p=. *Wherever directories and files are mentioned, they refer to the appropriate*
*path/name/etc supplied during <%= section_link 'rake task configuration' %>*.
*In all cases the default settings can be seen in the layout created by the*
*@rote create foo@ command.*

<%= section 4, 'The Basics', false %>

As mentioned, templates are simply files in the specifed pages directory 
(@doc/pages@ by default) that match the supplied glob (default: all files,
though ruby source is implicitly excluded). The directory layout beneath the
page root is retained when transforming pages, and is also used to provide
hierarchical structure to the common page code.

The default behaviour is to transform all matched 
<%= section_link 'template code and erb', 'templates' %> pages with ERB, and 
optionally apply a second render pass with a <%= section_link 'layout' %>,
before writing to the same base filename beneath the output directory.
You can customise this behaviour by specifying 
<%= section_link 'extension mappings' %> for specific file extensions - 
see the <%= section_link 'Rake task configuration' %> section for details.

Each page and layout template used by Rote may have associated with it an 
optional Ruby source file, allowing variables to be defined for use in ERB
code, and supporting interaction with Rote via the methods of the 
"@Rote::Page@":<%= link_rel '/rdoc/classes/Rote/Page.html' %> class. Page
and layout code is loaded from a @rb@ file alongside the template itself.
Code can also be applied across multiple pages based on filesystem hierarchy
by placing it in @COMMON.rb@ files in the *pages* tree. The order of evaluation
of these files travels down from the most remote COMMON.rb to the page code
itself, and this provides a simple yet fairly powerful way to apply various
configuration options, filtering, and user variables across your pages.
See <%= section_link 'template code and erb' %> for more information on the
search path and evaluation order for page code.

Rote additionally allows a variety of formatting and postprocessing options
thanks to it's support for <%= section_link 'filters' %> - little bits of Ruby 
that perform some text transformation, macro expansion, or postprocessing 
during page rendering. Rote provides standard filters to support Textile 
and Markdown formatting, syntax highlighting, processing with HTMLTidy, and
more. 

<%= section 4, 'Template code and ERB' %>

All templates may contain embedded Ruby code (ERB), delimited by the standard
&lt;&#37; ... &#37;&gt; (for executed code) and &lt;&#37;= ... &#37;&gt; (for 
output) tags. Any (valid) Ruby code may be placed in the templates, and 
variables may be defined to allow information to be passed into templates.
There are four places where you might define such variables. The following 
is in order of evaluation:

* A block supplied to the <%= section_link 'extension mappings', 'extension mapping' %>
  that matched this page (if any).
* Any COMMON.rb files from the filesystem root down to this directory.
* This page's ruby code, _basename_.rb.
* In the template itself (via ERB).

When a @Page@ instance is created, Rote looks for these, and if found evaluates
them, in order, in the same binding as the template is later rendered in (i.e. 
the @Page@ instance binding). Therefore, you can define instance variables to 
pass data around, or even helper methods if you wish.

Additionally, when <%= section_link 'layout' %> is used the following evaluation 
takes place *after rendering the template text* and can be used to make variables 
available for the layout pass(es):

* This layout's ruby code, _layout_basename_.rb.
* In the layout itself (again, with ERB).

Template code is used to support a great deal of flexibility in Rote, from 
selecting layouts to mixing in format helpers to controlling the filter chain.
You can find details of the methods available in the 
"@Rote::Page@ RDoc":<%= link_rel '/rdoc/classes/Rote/Page.html' %>

<%= section 4, 'Plaintext Formatting' %>

If you are using Rote to generate HTML, you'll probably want to utilise some
kind of _plain-text formatting_. Rote has out-of-the-box support for
Textile, Markdown, and RDoc formatting, which can be applied to any page using 
standard <%= section_link 'filters' %>. 

These filters can be applied to any page directly from page or common code,
and if you are using the built-in Rakefile (either using the @rote@ command to
build, or with a @rake@ build created with the @rote create@ command) then
the following extension mappings are defined by default, allowing the filters
to be applied without resorting to page code:

  .mhtml or .markdown      => Markdown formatting, .html output
  .thtml or .textile       => Textile formatting, .html output
  .rdhtml or .rdoc         => RDoc formatting, .html output
  
Each of these filters is covered (along with further usage instructions) in
the <%= section_link 'filters' %> section.   

<%= section 4, 'Layout' %>

_Layouts_ allow common template to be applied across several pages.
This is handled via multiple render passes, with each layout responsible
for including the previously rendered content (via ERB).

Layouts are stored under the @doc/layouts@ directory (by default). They may
be organised into subdirectories, but this hierarchy is not connected to
the hierarchy in @pages@. To apply a layout to a page, simply call the
@Rote::Page.layout@ method from code applied to that page, passing the
base-name (and path, relative to @layouts@, if used). If no extension is
specified, then the same extension as the page itself is assumed. Examples:

  * layout 'one'
  * layout 'main/wide'
  * layout 'dark.txt'
  * &lt;&#37; layout 'my' &#37;&gt;
  
_*Note* the absence of the = sign in the ERB tag in the last example,_
_indicating that this is code to be executed rather than code that should_
_generate output._

With that done, Rote would first render the template text (including textile)
and set the Page instance variable @\@content_for_layout@ before rendering 
the layout (in which textile is currently not supported). The layout is
responsible for inserting the rendered template where appropriate, with
e.g.:

  * &lt;&#37;= @content_for_layout &#37;&gt;

This pattern shouldn't be unfamiliar. Again, note that Rote doesn't mandate 
HTML, despite the appearance from the ERB tags - any (textual) format can
be templated and laid out.

h5. Layout code

Like page templates, each layout may have associated with it some layout 
code, which is executed just prior to rendering the layout, in the same
way as the page code.

There is no equivalent of @COMMON.rb@ for layout templates, however.

h5. Nested layout

Layout code (see above) may call the @Page#layout@ method (i.e. to apply
a layout). This will result in the result of the current rendering being
passed (via <code>@content_for_layout</code>) to the specified layout
in a further render pass. In all respects this is no different from the
initial layout pass - layout code is executed, and rendering performed.
Obviously, this may result in additional layouts being applied to the page.

<div class='note'>
Layouts can only be nested by calling @layout@ again from *layout code* 
(or ERB in the layout template itself). Multiple calls to @layout@ from
@COMMON.rb@ or page code will result in consistent page code behaviour,
i.e. any previously-specified layout will be overriden.
</div>

There are no special requirements for layouts that are used in this way -
from the user point of view a layout simply needs to include the 
<code>@content_for_layout</code> where appropriate.

All layouts are rendered prior to post filtering. 

<%= section 4, 'Filters' %>

As well as rendering ERB and applying layout (both universal features of @Page@),
Rote provides the ability to apply custom _filters_ to a page or set of pages.
Along with this ability, a number of filters are provided as standard:

For example If you're generating HTML, you'll probably want to use some plaintext 
formatting, rather than writing HTML by hand. Rote directly supports this
(thanks to "RedCloth":http://whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/redcloth and 
"BlueCloth":http://www.deveiate.org/projects/BlueCloth) via _filters_, with
Textile, RDoc and Markdown support out of the box (assuming those libraries are 
available on your machine). See the <%= section_link 'plaintext formatting' %>
for more details on this.

h5. Filter chaining

In order to filter a given page, filter instances are added to that page's 
filter chain. There are actually two separate chains, for _page filtering_
and _post filtering_.

	* *Page filtering* takes place on the page content itself, after any
		ERB is executed, but before the layout pass is applied. Most of the
		standard filters are pre-filters.
		
	* *Post filtering* takes place on the final output of the render pass,
		after layout is applied. The @Filters::Tidy@ filter is a post filter. 
		
Adding filters to a page's chain can be done anywhere you can call that page's filter-chain
methods. This could be page code, COMMON.rb, or even inside the template itself. Filters
can also be applied to all files with a matching extension by adding filters inside an
<%= section_link 'extension mappings', 'extension mapping' %> block. Bear in mind that the
order in which filters are added *is* important, since each filters output becomes input 
for the next. You must ensure that filters are applied in a compatible order - should you 
need to prepend filters or otherwise modify the chain prior to rendering you may do so by
directly accessing the @page_filters@ and @post_filters@ array attributes.

See <%= section_link 'template code and erb', 'the section on template code' %> 
for more information on adding code to your pages.
		
h5. Standard filters

Rote supplies the following filters 'out of the box':

h6. *"Filters::BlueCloth":<%= link_rel '/rdoc/classes/Rote/Filters/RedCloth.html' %>* -
Supports conversion of plain-text (Markdown) formatting to HTML.
	  
This is a text filter, and should be applied in the _page filter chain_:
		
#:code#ruby#
  # in page code or common.rb
  page_filter Filters::BlueCloth.new
#:code#
	  
h6. *"Filters::Exec":<%= link_rel '/rdoc/classes/Rote/Filters/Exec.html' %>* -
Pipes the macro body to an external command, and replaces the macro with
the output of that command.
	  
This is a macro filter, and should be applied in the _page filter chain_:
	  
#:code#ruby#
  # in page code or common.rb
  page_filter Filters::Exec.new
#:code#
	  
Code can then be inserted in the page like:
	  
#:code#
  #:exec#python#
    print "Hello, World"
  #:exec#
#:code#
		
h6. *"Filters::Eval":<%= link_rel '/rdoc/classes/Rote/Filters/Eval.html' %>* -
Evaluates the macro body as Ruby code, capturing standard output and using it as 
the macro replacement.
	  
This is a macro filter, and should be applied in the _page filter chain_:
	  
#:code#ruby#
  # in page code or common.rb
  page_filter Filters::Eval.new
#:code#
	  
Code can then be inserted in the page like:
	  
#:code#
  #:eval#
    puts "Hello, World"
  #:eval#
#:code#
		
h6. *"Filters::RDoc":<%= link_rel '/rdoc/classes/Rote/Filters/RDoc.html' %>* -
Supports RDoc formatting with optional custom markup, to any supported output format
(defaults to HTML).
	  
This is a text filter, and should be applied in the _page filter chain_:
		
#:code#ruby#
  # in page code or common.rb
  page_filter Filters::RDoc.new
#:code#
	  
h6. *"Filters::RedCloth":<%= link_rel '/rdoc/classes/Rote/Filters/RedCloth.html' %>* -
Supports conversion of plain-text (Textile) formatting to HTML.
	  
This is a text filter, and should be applied in the _page filter chain_:
		
#:code#ruby#
  # in page code or common.rb
  page_filter Filters::RedCloth.new
#:code#
	  
h6. *"Filters::Syntax":<%= link_rel '/rdoc/classes/Rote/Filters/Syntax.html' %>* -
Supports @code@ <%= section_link 'macros' %> with pluggable syntax highlighting
(via the "Syntax library":http://syntax.rubyforge.org/) and Ruby-code support
out of the box.
	  
This is a macro filter, and should be applied in the _page filter chain_:
		
#:code#ruby#
  # in page code or common.rb
  page_filter Filters::Syntax.new
#:code#	  

This filter uses the "Syntax":http://syntax.rubyforge.org/ library, passing the
macro argument as the language ('ruby', 'xml' and 'yaml' are supported out of the 
box). The output is wrapped in 
&lt;pre class='[language]'&gt;&lt;code&gt; ... &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
for output, with highlighting handled by <span> tags, allowing syntax colours and 
styles to be applied via CSS. You can find a full list of the Ruby highlight classes
in the "Syntax documentation":http://syntax.rubyforge.org/chapter-2.html
but you will need to experiment with the highlighter to find the XML and YAML 
classes.

Code to be highlighted is inserted into pages like so:

#:code#
  #:code#[language]#
    def amethod
      "some code"		
    end	
  #:code
#:code#

<div class='note'>
Note that the closing tag in the above example is missing a closing '#' - this works
around a limitation of the current Syntax filter (and macro implementation in general),
which means that a macro cannot contain it's own end-tag.
</div>

Since macros are rendered separately from the page text, you don't have to worry much
about spacing and so forth - your code will not be touched by any of the formatting
filters.

h6. *"Filters::Tidy":<%= link_rel '/rdoc/classes/Rote/Filters/Tidy.html' %>* -
Post filter that corrects markup and semantic errors in HTML markup to produce
valid HTML or XHTML using the "HTML Tidy":http://tidy.sourceforge.net/ command-line
tool.
	  
This is a *post filter*. It should be applied in the appropriate filter chain:
		
#:code#ruby#
  # in page code or common.rb
  post_filter Filters::Tidy.new
#:code#	  
	  
h6. *"Filters::TOC":<%= link_rel '/rdoc/classes/Rote/Filters/TOC.html' %>* -
Supports automatic generation of basic navigation from headings in documents.
See the RDoc for more details. It should be applied as a page filter, and
a reference is usually required for use in the layout:
	  
#:code#ruby#
  # in page code or common.rb
  post_filter @toc = Filters::TOC.new
#:code#	  

Some of the filters support various options to change the way they operate, and
many support different arguments (the second part of the #macro#args# tags) to
those shown above - see the RDoc for the individual macros (linked from the headings
above) for more details.	  

Filters are of course very simple to write. See the 'Writing filters' subsection
(in <%= section_link 'Extending Rote' %>) for details, including how to implement
your own macro filters.

<%= section 4, 'Format helpers' %>

p{color:red}. *TODO* This section is under construction.
Please see "@Rote::Format::HTML@":<%= link_rel '/rdoc/classes/Rote/Format/HTML.html' %> 
for currently available information.

<%= section 3, 'Resources' %>

Of course, you're likely to have resources for your site (images, sounds, etc)
and you'll need to copy them over to the target too. Such resources should be
placed under @doc/res@ (with the commandline setup) or in your specified @res@
directory (from a Rakefile).

As you'd expect, the directory layout beneath @res@ should mirror that of the 
output, and will be preserved during the copy. Resources are copied only if
necessary (determined by existence and last-modified timestamp), in a similar
way to pages.

<%= section 3, 'Rake task configuration' %>

<%= section 4, 'Reference Rakefile' %>

The following Rakefile demonstrates most of the methods you can use to customise
Rote's rake task configuration.

#:code#ruby#  
# Rakefile
require 'rote'
include Rote

# This defines all our Rake tasks. The symbol we supply here (:doc is 
# default) gives the base-prefix for the tasks that are generated.
ws = Rote::DocTask.new(:doc) do |doc| 
	# Output directory and layout sources
  doc.output_dir = 'html'
  doc.layout_dir = 'doc/layouts'
  
	# Page directory and include globs.
  doc.pages.dir = 'doc/pages'
  doc.pages.include('**/*')  
	
	# Resource directory and include globs. This directory
	# could be the same as the pages directory.
  doc.res.dir = 'doc/res/'
  doc.res.include('**/*.png')
  doc.res.include('**/*.gif')
  doc.res.include('**/*.jpg')
  doc.res.include('**/*.css')  
  
  # Define an extension mapping
  doc.ext_mapping(/(html)/, '$1') do |page|
    # Let's use the HTML helpers everywhere ...
    page.extend Format::HTML
    
    # use 'page' layout on all html files
    # This can also be set from COMMON.rb
    page.layout 'page'

		# textile formatting, ruby syntax
    page.page_filter Filters::RedCloth.new(:textile)
    page.page_filter Filters::Syntax.new
    
    # To valid xhtml with Tidy postfilter
    page.post_filter Filters::Tidy
  end
end 
#:code#

Please refer to the "RDoc":<%= link_rel '/rdoc/classes/Rote/DocTask.html' %> for specific
information on each method.

<%= section 4, 'Extension mappings' %>

The default behaviour when transforming pages is to make each filename 
matched by the @pages.include@ glob relative to the output directory, using
the same extension as the input file. 

If you want to change this behaviour, you may supply an _extension mapping_
as demonstrated above. The general form is:

#:code#ruby#
# Define an extension mapping
doc.ext_mapping(/regexp/, 'replacement') do |page|

  # call page methods 

end
#:code#

The regexp is matched against processed page extensions (not resources) and 
the replacement supplies the output extension. The optional block is executed
*for each matching page* during instantiation, before any COMMON or page 
code. Note that you *must not* include the leading '.' in either the regexp or
replacement - doing so will fail to match the desired extensions.

For more advanced mappings, you can supply a capturing regexp, and use the
@$n@ notation in the replacement to extract the captures. As shown in the
(contrived) example below:

#:code#ruby#
doc.ext_mapping(/(html)/, '$1') do |page|

  # do stuff
  
end
#:code#

Extension mappings also support per-extension output directories, which
can be supplied as a third parameter to the @ext_mapping@ method:

doc.output_dir = 'html'

#:code#ruby#
doc.ext_mapping(/ttxt/, 'txt', 'plaintext') do |page|

  # do stuff
  
end
#:code#

Where no output directory is supplied, the default output directory will
be used.

<%= section 4, 'Defining additional tasks' %>

The command-line build will automatically look for a file in the top-level
directory (above @doc@) named @local.rf@. If found, this file will be 
evaluated by Rake, making any tasks defined within it available to your
build. This can be used to define an <%= section_link 'auto refresh task' %>
for the <%= section_link 'source monitoring', 'monitor' %> feature, for example,
or to define tasks to publish your site (most likely using one of Rake's 
directory publishers).

<%= section 3, 'Source monitoring' %>

When making changes to a documentation set, you frequently need to render out
your changes to check formatting or ensure something works correctly. In this
situation it's inconvenient to keep dropping out to your shell to run @rote@
(or @rake@) manually, particularly when making a lot of incremental changes.

Fortunately, Rote provides a simple mechanism for monitoring your documentation
source and automatically performing updates as needed. Simply specify the 
@doc_monitor@ task and Rote will go into a loop, periodically running the
top-level _doc_ task which will transform / copy any pages or resources that
have been modified. It will of course take notice of any custom file or directory
dependencies you add to the doc task (e.g. to generate RDoc as part of a
website), and in turn monitor their dependent files too (for example rebuilding
the RDoc if you modify a source file). It does *not* however attempt to track
format-specific dependencies _between_ resources (such as which pages use which
CSS), since this would imply some knowledge of the format in use. In practice
this means that you may need to trigger a clean build after updating such
resources, although it is actually fairly easy to set up this kind of 
relationship by specifying that certain file-tasks relating to pages depend 
on the appropriate file-tasks representing the resources (for instance).

By default, @monitor@ checks for updates approximately once
per second, but you can specify a custom value _when using a Rakefile_ by
setting @monitor_interval@ in the block passed to @DocTask.new@.

*Note* that the monitor functionality is deliberately kept simple with respect
to IO and concurrency, reflecting the fact that output files are rarely
anything more than that - it would be almost pointless to complicate the
way monitoring works with any kind of semaphore or file-locking scheme.
Of course if this does cause problems in your particular scenario, let me know
because it just might make me reconsider.

When you're done with Rote simply hit CTRL-C (or use @kill@) to stop monitoring
and exit.

<%= section 4, 'Auto refresh task' %>

When using Source monitoring, it's often handy to be able to inform some other
program that something has changed. For example, you may want to automatically
refresh your browser after changed HTML is rendered. Rote supports this via
the @doc_refresh@ task, which is triggered whenever @doc_monitor@ finds changes
in your source set (_after_ rendering, of course).

The following (Mac) example uses OSA script to refresh the Safari browser when
your rendered documentation changes:

#:code#ruby#
  require 'osx/aeosa'
	
  task :doc_refresh do 
    OSX.do_osascript('tell application "Safari" to do javascript "window.location.reload();" in document 1')	
  end  
#:code#ruby#

As with all rake tasks, multiple actions can be associated, and you can of course
add prerequisites to the @refresh@ task as with any other Rake task.

<%= section 3, 'Publishing' %>

Rote does not provide any direct support for publishing your site at present,
relying on you to configure an appropriate publish task if required, using
the publishers supplied with Rake (in @rake/contrib@), or your own. This 
allows maximum flexibility, and allows Rote to concentrate on creating your 
documents.

See the section <%= section_link 'Defining additional tasks' %> for details on
how to supply your publish tasks.

See the <%= section_link 'rake task configuration' %> section for more details.

<%= section 3, 'Extending Rote' %>

Although Rote is designed to be as quick and easy to use as possible,
with sensible default configuration and reasonable convention throughout,
it also has ample flexibility when it comes to generating more complex
documentation sets. Thanks to it's 'option for every default' and simple
extension points, Rote should scale to even complex documentation sets
quite easily.

<%= section 4, 'Writing filters' %>

*Filters* do exactly what they say on the tin - they filter the output of
a page, perhaps rendering markup or inserting additional text. Filters
can be divided into two general categories: *Text filters* and *Macro filters*.
Either type can be a page or post filter - it depends only on the design
of the filter and the job it will perform as to which chain it should
be used with.

h5. Text Filters

Text filters process the text in a page, with all macros replaced by a 
standard plain-text marker. The purpose of this is to allow macros
to coexist with plain-text formatting without causing markup clashes.

Most of the standard filters are text filters. The RedCloth filter
is representative:

#:code#ruby#
class RedCloth < TextFilter
  def initialize(*redcloth_opts)
    super()
    @redcloth_opts = redcloth_opts
  end      
  
  def handler(text,page)
    rc = ::RedCloth.new(text)        
    # hack around a RedCloth warning
    rc.instance_eval { @lite_mode = false }  
    rc.to_html(*@redcloth_opts) 
  end      
end    
#:code#

(again, this example is slightly simplified with respect to auxiliary
functionality for the sake of clarity).

As mentioned above, @TextFilter@ also provides help with writing non-macro
filters that removes much of the headache of working around macros (which 
must not be modified by any filter except that which handles the macro). 

Text filters can optionally access the macro data using the @macros@ array.

If you want to implement a one-off filter quickly, there's no need to 
create a new subclass - you can supply a block directly to TextFilter,
which is executed to render the textual content:

#:code#ruby#
page.page_filter Rote::Filters::TextFilter.new { |page, text|
  text.gsub(/foo/,'bar')
}
#:code#

For text filters, a convenience in the implementation of @page_filter@ 
allows the above to be shortened to:

#:code#ruby#
page.page_filter do |page, text|
  text.gsub(/foo/,'bar')
end
#:code#

Note the curly braces in the first example, which cause the block to bind
to the filter rather than the method. If @do..end@ were used, the second
form would actually be called and a new filter created. The block filter you
supplied would be discarded.

The @post_filter@ method supports the same convenience.

h5. Macro Filters

The standard Syntax filter is a typical macro filter. The following is
slightly simplified for brevity (the actual one allows custom macro tags
to be supplied):

#:code#ruby#
class Syntax < MacroFilter
  def macro_code(lang, body)
    converter = ::Syntax::Convertors::HTML.for_syntax(lang)
    "<pre class='#{lang}'><code>#{converter.convert(body,false)}</code></pre>"
  end      
end      
#:code#

As you can see, a macro filter simply inherits @Rote::Filters::MacroFilter@
and implements one or more @macro_XXXX@ methods, which is passed the arguments
supplied to the macro (used here to indicate the code language) and the
raw macro body.

If you want to implement a macro quickly, perhaps across a section or set of
pages, you can use @MacroFilter@ itself, supplying a block:

#:code#ruby#
page.page_filter Rote::Filters::MacroFilter.new([:foomacro]) { |tag, args, body
  "FooMacro Replacement!"
}
#:code#

This can be done from any page code, a COMMON.rb (see 
<%= section_link 'Template code and ERB' %>), or on a per-extension basis
with <%= section_link 'extension mappings' %>.

*Note* that macro data is passed raw, and excluded from rendering by 
<%= section_link 'text filters' %>. The output, however, *will* be processed
by any filters that follow the macro filter in the chain.

h5. Duck Filters

This being Ruby, you don't _have_ to inherit one of the above filters to create
your own - a filter is just an object with a @filter(text,page)@ method.

The standard TOC filter takes this route. 

<%= section 4, 'Rake Extensions' %>

Rote supplies a number of non-intrusive extensions a number of the Rake classes,
in order to support dynamic dependency caching, caching dependency-based block
memoize, and task reset for use in monitor mode. These features are very new, and
only lightly documented at present. You are advised to see the 
"RDoc":<%= link_rel '/rdoc' %> and source if you want to find out more.

These extensions were almost exclusively contributed by Jonathan Paisley.

h5. Dynamic dependency caching

Since layout files are specified in Ruby code, and may be calculated dynamically,
it's not possible to determine the layout files upon which a given page depends
without running that page's code (including all COMMON.rb files that apply to it,
extension mapping blocks, and so forth). This would have (or, had) an adverse
impact on Rote's incremental build functionality, especially from the point of 
view of source monitoring. 

This problem is addressed by a small Rake extension that adds the ability to
dynamically register dependencies on the current task, and to have those 
dependencies cached when Rake exits. Internally, Rote automatically registers
any layouts loaded by a page, and you can easily register additional dependencies
from any Ruby code, by calling methods on the @Rake@ module.

*Note* that this extension is intended, and tested, for Rote - it is not designed
to be a general extension (though one could easily be extracted from it). In 
particular it takes advantage of other extended functionality provided by Rote,
and takes no account, for example, of parallel task execution. 

By default, the cache is maintained in the project root, in a directory named
@.rake_cache@. This is managed by Rote, so for the most part can be ignored, 
though you can of course supply an alternate path if you wish (via @Rake.cache_dir=@).

h6. Caching and clean builds

When performing a clean build, the cache will also be removed (as part of the 
@clobber@ task), and all dependencies will be re-evaluated and cached afresh.
Caching exists only to allow accurate dependency resolution during incremental
builds.

h6. Disabling the cache

There may be occasions when you want to disable use of the cache (for example when
diagnosing unexpected dependency chains). This can be accomplished by setting
an environment variable, NO_RAKE_CACHE prior to invoking Rote (or Rake). For a
single invocation, the easiest way to do this is from the command-line:

<pre><code>
	rake clobber doc NO_RAKE_CACHE=true
</code></pre>

Specifying this option (or setting the variable) will completely disable use of
the cache, causing any existing cache to be ignored and all dependencies determined
during the run to be discarded.

h5. Dependency-based block memoize

Somewhat related to dependency caching, Rote also provides the ability to memoize
Ruby block results, caching them to disk, and only execute the block during 
incremental builds. This is handy if, for example, you want to incorporate information
derived from external commands, for example, or index large files in your documentation.

The following (OSX-specific) example illustrates usage of this feature:

#:code#ruby#
  def image_size(fn)
    Rake::Task.memoize "image_size" => fn do
      # This code only runs if the cache is out-of-date with
      # respect to the file
      puts "image_size for #{fn}"
      
      # OSX-specific stuff here
      s = `sips -g pixelWidth -g pixelHeight #{fn}`
      [s[/pixelWidth: (\d+)/,1], s[/pixelHeight: (\d+)/,1]]
    end
  end
#:code#

<%= section 3, 'Final notes' %>

Rake is a *very* flexible tool, and supports a wide variety of configuration
options and advanced features you can use to fit Rote to your needs. Such 
configuration is (far) beyond the scope of this manual - see 
"Rake's Documentation":http://rake.rubyforge.org/ for information on the 
features supported by Rake.
