h2. Rote - A static website build tool for Ruby

*Rote is a simple page-based template system for your static website that was written
to make it easier to author and maintain non-dynamic websites and offline documentation.*
Rote provides a simple commandline build for your pages (integration with existing Rakefiles
is also planned) that renders your pages (supporting Textile and ERB), applies layout,
and optionally handles upload to your (host's) server.

h3. So where is it?

Well, it's still in CVS. It's still pretty new and not _quite_ ready for a release yet.
It won't be long, but if you're impatient (or just bored), the 
"Project page on Rubyforge":http://rubyforge.org/projects/rote has everything you need
to get going with the CVS version.

From there, read the README. Obviously, this site is still under construction too.
