*Rote is a simple page-based template system that was written to make it easier to author and maintain non-dynamic websites and offline documentation.* Rote provides a simple commandline or "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org based build for your pages, with page rendering (optionally supporting RDoc formatting, Textile and Markdown with "RedCloth":http://redcloth.rubyforge.org/ and ruby code with "ERB":http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/erb/rdoc/classes/ERB.html), layout, and general documentation / website build tasks.

h3. Features

Rote offers the following major features:

	* Simple set-up based on page templates and sections.
	* ERB, Textile, Markdown and RDoc supported out of the box.
	* Multiple configurable layouts apply boilerplate to your pages.
	* Apply arbitrary Ruby code across all documentation, a subset, or individual pages.
	* Can be used standalone (from the command-line) or within "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org as a custom task library.
	* Supports any (text-based) format, while providing utilities and helpers for common formats.
	* Flexible filtering with several standard filters and the ability to implement your own in a few lines of Ruby.
	* Low-overhead monitoring functionality allows documentation to be automatically re-rendered, and custom processing done, whenever the source changes.

Rote is somewhat similar to "WebGen":http://webgen.rubyforge.org in intent, though the two are quite different in implementation. WebGen provides a richer environment geared more toward end-user websites and content publishing, whereas Rote's implementation as an extension to Rake reflects a bias toward software documentation and general textual templating.

See the "User guide":<%= link_rel '/guide' %> and "RDoc":<%= link_rel '/rdoc' %> for usage information.

h3. Download?

You can get Rote via "RubyGems":http://rubygems.org if you have it:

	* <strong><code>gem install -r rote</code></strong>

Alternatively, you can download tarball / zip packages if you don't: 

  * <strong>"http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1120":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1120</strong>


h4. From Git

You can also grab the latest code from "our GitHub page":http://github.com/roscopeco/rote .

The master branch has the most up to date working development code while the latest release can be found on the appropriate tag for that version. Although every effort is made to ensure that this development code works, it cannot of course be guaranteed to be complete or bug free. If that's okay with you (maybe you're pretty happy-go-lucky in general...) then see our "GitHub page":http://github.com/roscopeco/rote for everything you need to get going with the Git version.
