*Rote is a simple page-based template system that was written to make it 
easier to author and maintain non-dynamic websites and 
offline documentation.* Rote provides a simple commandline or 
"Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org based build for your pages, with page 
rendering (optionally supporting RDoc formatting, Textile and Markdown with 
"RedCloth":http://redcloth.rubyforge.org/ and ruby code with
"ERB":http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/erb/rdoc/classes/ERB.html), layout,
and general documentation / website build tasks.

h3. Features

Rote offers the following major features:

	* Simple set-up based on page templates and sections.
	* ERB, Textile, Markdown and RDoc supported out of the box.
	* Multiple configurable layouts apply boilerplate to your pages.
	* Apply arbitrary Ruby code across all documentation, a subset, or individual pages.
	* Can be used standalone (from the command-line) or within "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org
	  as a custom task library.
	* Supports any (text-based) format, while providing utilities and helpers for
	  common formats.
	* Flexible filtering with several standard filters and the ability to
	  implement your own in a few lines of Ruby.
	* Low-overhead monitoring functionality allows documentation to be automatically
	  re-rendered, and custom processing done, whenever the source changes.

Rote is somewhat similar to "WebGen":http://webgen.rubyforge.org in intent, though the two
are quite different in implementation. WebGen provides a richer environment geared more 
toward end-user websites and content publishing, whereas Rote's implementation as an 
extension to Rake reflects a bias toward software documentation and general textual templating.

See the "User guide":<%= link_rel '/guide' %> and "RDoc":<%= link_rel '/rdoc' %> for usage information.

h3. Download?

You can get Rote via "RubyGems":http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems if you have it:

	* <strong><code>gem install -r rote</code></strong>

Alternatively, you can download tarball / zip packages if you don't: 

  * <strong>"http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1120":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1120</strong>

You can also grab the latest code from "SVN":http://rubyforge.org/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php/?root=rote

h4. From Subversion

A link to the latest stable release can be found from the "project page":http://rubyforge.org/projects/rote .

You can also grab the latest code from Subversion . The trunk always has the most up to date development code 
while the latest release, while can be found on the appropriate tag for that version. Although every effort 
is made to ensure that this development code works, it cannot of course be guaranteed to be complete or bug 
free. If that's okay with you (maybe you're pretty happy-go-lucky in general...) then see our 
"SCM page":http://rubyforge.org/scm/?group_id=1120 at Rubyforge for everything you need to get going with 
the SVN version.
