h2. Rote - A static website build tool for Ruby

*Rote is a simple page-based template system for your static website that was 
written to make it easier to author and maintain non-dynamic websites and 
offline documentation.* Rote provides a simple commandline or 
"Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org based build for your pages, with page 
rendering (optionally supporting Textile and Markdown with 
"RedCloth":http://redcloth.rubyforge.org/ and ruby code with
"ERB":http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/erb/rdoc/classes/ERB.html), layout,
and general documentation / website build tasks.

h3. Features

Rote offers the following major features:

	* Simple set-up based on page templates and sections.
	* ERB, Textile, and Markdown supported out of the box.
	* Multiple configurable layouts apply boilerplate to your pages.
	* 'Scoped' Ruby code support allows fine-grained control of data available across 
	  all documentation, a subset, or individual pages.
	* Can be used standalone (from the command-line) or from within "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org
	  as a custom task library.
	* Supports any (text-based) format, while providing utilities and helpers for
	  common formats (HTML at present).

h3. So where is it?

The first release of Rote can be downloaded from "Our FRS on RubyForge":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1120 .
It should be also available as a RubyGem (rote-0.1.0) in the usual way.
The "README":rdoc/files/README.html has the most comprehensive user guide at the moment.  Obviously, this
site is still under construction too.

You can also grab the latest code from "CVS":http://rubyforge.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/?cvsroot=rote. 

Please note that Rote is still pretty new, and while this first release is fairly functional, it's
also still shiny and new, and liable to break down, destroy data, and run away with your spouse if
given half a chance. Check out the "Project page on Rubyforge":http://rubyforge.org/projects/rote 
for everything you need to get going with the CVS version.
