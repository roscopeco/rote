*Rote is a simple page-based template system that was written to make it 
easier to author and maintain non-dynamic websites and 
offline documentation.* Rote provides a simple commandline or 
"Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org based build for your pages, with page 
rendering (optionally supporting Textile and Markdown with 
"RedCloth":http://redcloth.rubyforge.org/ and ruby code with
"ERB":http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/erb/rdoc/classes/ERB.html), layout,
and general documentation / website build tasks.

h3. Features

Rote offers the following major features:

	* Simple set-up based on page templates and sections.
	* ERB, Textile, and Markdown supported out of the box.
	* Multiple configurable layouts apply boilerplate to your pages.
	* 'Scoped' Ruby code support allows fine-grained control of data available across 
	  all documentation, a subset, or individual pages.
	* Can be used standalone (from the command-line) or from within "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org
	  as a custom task library.
	* Supports any (text-based) format, while providing utilities and helpers for
	  common formats (HTML at present).

Rote is somewhat similar to (though simpler than) 
"WebGen":http://webgen.rubyforge.org , which provides a richer environment
geared more toward websites and content publishing (whereas Rote's
implementation as an extension to Rake reflects a bias toward software 
documentation).

See the "User guide":<%= link_rel '/guide' %> and "RDoc":<%= link_rel '/rdoc' %> for usage information.

h3. Download?

Alternatively, you can download tarball / zip packages from: 

  * <strong>"http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1120":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1120</strong>

You can also grab the latest code from "CVS":http://rubyforge.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/?cvsroot=rote. 

h4. From CVS 

A link to the latest stable release can be found from the "project page":http://rubyforge.org/projects/rote .

Please note that Rote is still pretty new, and while currently fairly functional, it's
also still shiny and new, and liable to break down, destroy data, and run away with your spouse if
given half a chance. Sound like fun? Then check out the "Project page on Rubyforge":http://rubyforge.org/projects/rote 
for everything you need to get going with the CVS version!
