*Rote is a simple page-based template system that was written to make it 
easier to author and maintain non-dynamic websites and 
offline documentation.* Rote provides a simple commandline or 
"Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org based build for your pages, with page 
rendering (optionally supporting RDoc formatting, Textile and Markdown with 
"RedCloth":http://redcloth.rubyforge.org/ and ruby code with
"ERB":http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/erb/rdoc/classes/ERB.html), layout,
and general documentation / website build tasks.

h3. Features

Rote offers the following major features:

	* Simple set-up based on page templates and sections.
	* ERB, Textile, Markdown and RDoc supported out of the box.
	* Multiple configurable layouts apply boilerplate to your pages.
	* 'Scoped' Ruby code support allows fine-grained control of data available across 
	  all documentation, a subset, or individual pages.
	* Can be used standalone (from the command-line) or within "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org
	  as a custom task library.
	* Supports any (text-based) format, while providing utilities and helpers for
	  common formats (HTML at present, integration with CSS builder etc. hoped for).

Rote is somewhat similar to (though simpler than) 
"WebGen":http://webgen.rubyforge.org , which provides a richer environment
geared more toward websites and content publishing (whereas Rote's
implementation as an extension to Rake reflects a bias toward software 
documentation and general textual templating).

See the "User guide":<%= link_rel '/guide' %> and "RDoc":<%= link_rel '/rdoc' %> for usage information.

h3. Download?

You can get Rote via "RubyGems":http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems if you have it:

	* <strong><code>gem install -r rote</code></strong>

Alternatively, you can download tarball / zip packages if you don't: 

  * <strong>"http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1120":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1120</strong>

A link to the latest stable release can be found from the "project page":http://rubyforge.org/projects/rote .

h4. From SVN

You can also grab the latest code from "Subversion":http://rubyforge.org/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php/?root=rote .
The trunk always has the latest release, while the most up to date development code can be found on the
appropriate branch for that version. Although every effort is made to ensure that this development code
works, it cannot of course be guaranteed to be complete or bug free. If that's okay with you (maybe you're 
pretty happy-go-lucky in general...) then see our
"SCM page at Rubyforge":http://rubyforge.org/scm/?group_id=1120 for everything you need to get going with 
the SVN version.
