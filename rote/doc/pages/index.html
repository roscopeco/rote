h2. Rote - A static website build tool for Ruby

*Rote is a simple page-based template system for your static website that was 
written to make it easier to author and maintain non-dynamic websites and 
offline documentation.* Rote provides a simple commandline or 
"Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org based build for your pages, with page 
rendering (optionally supporting Textile and Markdown with 
"RedCloth":http://redcloth.rubyforge.org/ and ruby code with
"ERB":http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/erb/rdoc/classes/ERB.html), layout,
and general documentation / website build tasks.

h3. Features

Rote offers the following major features:

	* Simple set-up based on page templates and sections.
	* ERB, Textile, and Markdown supported out of the box.
	* Multiple configurable layouts apply boilerplate to your pages.
	* 'Scoped' Ruby code support allows fine-grained control of data available across 
	  all documentation, a subset, or individual pages.
	* Can be used standalone (from the command-line) or from within "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org
	  as a custom task library.
	* Supports any (text-based) format, while providing utilities and helpers for
	  common formats (HTML at present).

h3. So where is it?

Well, it's still in "CVS":http://rubyforge.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/?cvsroot=rote. It's still pretty new
and not _quite_ ready for a release yet. It won't be long, but if you're impatient (or just bored), the 
"Project page on Rubyforge":http://rubyforge.org/projects/rote has everything you need
to get going with the CVS version.

The "README":rdoc/files/README.html has the most comprehensive user guide at the moment.  Obviously, this
site is still under construction too.
