*Rote is a simple page-based template system that was written to make it 
easier to author and maintain non-dynamic websites and 
offline documentation.* Rote provides a simple commandline or 
"Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org based build for your pages, with page 
rendering (optionally supporting RDoc formatting, Textile and Markdown with 
"RedCloth":http://redcloth.rubyforge.org/ and ruby code with
"ERB":http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/erb/rdoc/classes/ERB.html), layout,
and general documentation / website build tasks.

h3. Features

Rote offers the following major features:

	* Simple set-up based on page templates and sections.
	* ERB, Textile, Markdown and RDoc supported out of the box.
	* Multiple configurable layouts apply boilerplate to your pages.
	* 'Scoped' Ruby code support allows fine-grained control of data available across 
	  all documentation, a subset, or individual pages.
	* Can be used standalone (from the command-line) or within "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org
	  as a custom task library.
	* Supports any (text-based) format, while providing utilities and helpers for
	  common formats (HTML at present, integration with CSS builder etc. hoped for).

Rote is somewhat similar to (though simpler than) 
"WebGen":http://webgen.rubyforge.org , which provides a richer environment
geared more toward websites and content publishing (whereas Rote's
implementation as an extension to Rake reflects a bias toward software 
documentation and general textual templating).

See the "User guide":<%= link_rel '/guide' %> and "RDoc":<%= link_rel '/rdoc' %> for usage information.

h3. Download?

You can get Rote via "RubyGems":http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems if you have it:

	* <strong><code>gem install -r rote</code></strong>

Alternatively, you can download tarball / zip packages if you don't: 

  * <strong>"http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1120":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1120</strong>

You can also grab the latest code from "CVS":http://rubyforge.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/?cvsroot=rote.

h4. From CVS 

A link to the latest stable release can be found from the "project page":http://rubyforge.org/projects/rote .

Please note that Rote is still fairly new, and though it's so far not shown itself to be particularly
anti-social, it's by no means a complete piece of kit. If that's okay with you (maybe you're 
pretty happy-go-lucky in general...) then see the "Project page on Rubyforge":http://rubyforge.org/projects/rote 
for everything you need to get going with the CVS version.
