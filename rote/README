= ROTE - A static website build tool for Ruby

== What is this?

Rote is a simple page-based template system that was written to make it
easier to author and maintain non-dynamic websites and offline documentation. 
Rote provides a simple commandline or Rake [http://rake.rubyforge.org] based 
build for your pages, with page rendering (optionally supporting Textile, 
Markdown, and embedded Ruby code with RedCloth [http://redcloth.rubyforge.org/]
and ERB [http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/erb/rdoc/classes/ERB.html]), 
layout, and general documentation / website build tasks.

== Should I download it?

I don't know. Rote offers the following major features:

* Simple set-up based on page templates and sections.
* ERB, Textile, and Markdown supported out of the box.
* Multiple configurable layouts apply boilerplate to your pages.
* 'Scoped' Ruby code support allows fine-grained control of data available across 
  all documentation, a subset, or individual pages.
* Can be used standalone (from the command-line) or from within Rake [http://rake.rubyforge.org]
  as a custom task library.
* Supports any (text-based) format, while providing utilities and helpers for
  common formats (HTML at present).
	  
So, should you?
  
== Why 'Rote'

The name? I tried to come up with a combination of 'Ruby Site', but couldn't
get past 'Rite' (it's already taken ;)). So, I changed a letter. I'm short on
imagination you know. Oh, you mean why the system? Well, to make it easier 
for me to manage roscopeco.co.uk now that I've dumped all the dynamic (JEE) 
stuff and gone back to good old Apache sans CGI. I want something that lets 
me do the disconnected page rendering and some of the 'dynamic' stuff, 
without the dynamic stuff.

If you really need a better explanation for the name, I've come up with these
alternatives:

* Something about 'the docs I rote'
* 'Rake-Oriented Template Extensions'
* 'Rote Only Talks Erb'
* 'Really? Ordinary Template Enhancements?'

== What else do I need?

Rote uses the following (versions are as per my development environment,
you may find you can use older versions, you may not).
	
* Ruby 1.8.3 ('yum install ruby' on Fedora 4)
* Rake 0.6.2 ('gem install rake')
* RedCloth 3.0.4 ('gem install RedCloth')

RubyGems (http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=126) is *highly recommended*,
and makes for not only an easier install but a cleaner library path.
Rote is tested with Gems 0.8.11.

== How do I install it ... 

=== ... with RubyGems?

If you have RubyGems, you can install Rote by simply issuing the command:

	gem install rote 
	
Which should download the latest version and install it, including
the 'rote' wrapper script and man pages.	If you experience problems,
or wish to perform an offline installation, then simply download the 
.gem file from the FRS, and execute the gem command from within the same
directory.

*Note* that the gem install currently doesn't install the man pages.
You will need to copy them to the appropriate location manually if using
this method.

=== ... using install.rb?

If you don't have RubyGems, you can install from one of the tarball or zip
packages, using the following command:

	ruby install.rb
	
from the unpacked root directory. This will copy the libaries to the 
appropriate	place, and set up the rote wrapper script, manpages, and so on.

=== ... in my own way?

If you're one of those people who just has to be different, then you'll be
pleased to know you can carry on that tradition, and place the files
pretty much where you like. Simply point an environment variable, 
ROTE_LIB, at the top-level lib directory (where rote.rb is found), and
ensure rote (or a symlink) is visible in your path. 

=== Did it work?

With that done, you should be able to run 

	rote --version
	
to verify that the command-line wrapper is working. You should of course see
the version number of your Rote installation.
 
== How do I use it?

=== From the command-line

If you are generating a standalone documentation set (i.e. not as part of 
some wider build) then you don't need to worry about writing a +Rakefile+ -
you can use the built-in build via the +rote+ command. This works with
a standard directory layout, and wraps invocation of +rake+ to handle
setting up library dependencies and generation of appropriate tasks.

You'll need something like the following directory layout:
  
  somesite ( <- root, this can be called whatever you like)
  |--> [publish.rf]
  |
  |--> doc
  |    |--> [COMMON.rb]
  |    |
  |    |--> res
  |    |    |--> (resources)
  |    |
  |    |--> layouts
  |    |    |--> one.rhtml
  |    |    |--> two.rhtml
  |    | 
  |    |--> pages
  |    |    |--> [COMMON.rb]
  |    |    |--> apage.txt
  |    |    |--> [apage.rb]
  |    |    |--> adir
  |    |    |    |--> [COMMON.rb]
  |    |    |    |--> bpage.html
  |    |    |    |--> [bpage.rb]   

Template sources under the 'pages' directory may have any extension (except
+rb+), and will be rendered to that same name under the output directory. 
See the section on Layouts below for details on layout name resolution.
Set up a simple test site following the above layout, and then run:

	rote
	
from the top-level directory (+somesite+), you should get a 'target' directory
created with the (transformed) templates.

Now try:

	rote --tasks
	
to get a list of valid tasks, or:
	
	rote --usage
	
for further option information.

=== From your +Rakefile+

If you are wanting to build documentation as part of a larger build process, or
commandline setup, then you'll want to get started on integrating Rote with 
your own (existing) +Rakefile+. Fortunately, this is very easy to do. Try 
something like:

	# Rakefile
	require 'rote'
	
	ws = Rote::DocTask.new(:doc) { |site| 
	  site.site_dir = 'html'
	  site.layout_dir = 'doc/layouts'
	
	  site.pages.dir = 'doc/pages'
	  site.pages.include('**/*')  
		  
	  site.res.dir = 'doc/res/'
	  site.res.include('**/*.png')
	  site.res.include('**/*.gif')
	  site.res.include('**/*.jpg')
	  site.res.include('**/*.css')
	}
	
Save this as +Rakefile+, and fire up:

	rake --libdir=$ROTE_HOME/lib doc

If all goes well, you should see each command and transformation output to your
console as Rote runs. 

*Note* that it's safe to include '**/*' in the +pages+ list, since +rb+ 
files are implicitly excluded.

== Creating templates

As mentioned, templates are simply text files in the doc/pages directory. The
layout below that directory is retained when transforming pages, and is
also used to provide simple hierarchical structure to the common page code.
By default, any file with an extension other than +rb+ will be processed
as a page template (with it's associated ruby source). The output will have
the same filename and path, relative to the output directory.

=== Template code and ERB

All templates may contain embedded Ruby code (ERB), delimited by the standard
<% ... %> (for executed code) and <%= ... %> (for output) tags. Any (valid) 
Ruby code may be placed in the templates, and variables may be defined to
allow information to be passed into templates. There are four places where 
you might define such variables. The following is in order of evaluation:

* This directory's COMMON.rb, or the parent directory's COMMON.rb if
  +inherit_common+ is used.
* This page's ruby code, _basename_.rb
* In a block passed to Page.new
* In the template itself

When a Rote::Page instance is created, Rote looks for these, and 
evaluates them, in order, in the same binding as the template is later rendered
in (i.e. the +Page+ instance binding). Therefore, you can define
instance variables to pass data around, or even helper methods if you wish.

=== Text to HTML formatting

Rote uses RedCloth (http://redcloth.rubyforge.org) to provide text to HTML 
formatting, supporting both Textile and Markdown. The formatting applied to a
given page is controlled by that page's +format_opts+ array. Both are disabled
by default - to enable formatting you must add something like the following
somewhere appropriate:

	format_opts << :textile << :markdown
	
Although you can directly assign to +format_opts+, this isn't recommended since
Ruby often interprets it as a local variable set rather than method call, 
resulting in much head scratching as to why your options are being ignored.

Formatting is applied _after_	any ERB has been evaluated.

*Note* that the options you supply are passed directly to RedCloth, so you can
exercise much more control over the formatting by using the feature-specific
symbols defined by RedCloth, rather than the blanket :textile and :markdown
symbols.

=== Layout

Layouts are stored under the doc/layouts directory (by default). They may
be organised into subdirectories, but this hierarchy is not connected to
the hierarchy in +pages+. To apply a layout to a page, simply call the
Rote::Page.layout method from code applied to that page, passing the
base-name (and path, relative to +layouts+, if used). If no extension is
specified, then the same extension as the page itself is assumed. Examples:

	layout 'one'
	layout 'main/wide'
	layout 'dark.txt'
	<% layout 'my' %>
	
With that done, Rote would first render the template text (including textile)
and set the Page instance variable @content_for_layout before rendering 
the layout (in which textile is currently not supported). The layout is
responsible for inserting the rendered template where appropriate, with
e.g.:

	<%= @content_for_layout %>
	
This pattern shouldn't be unfamiliar. Again, note that Rote doesn't mandate 
HTML, despite the appearance from the ERB tags - any (textual) format can
be templated and laid out.

== Resources

Of course, you're likely to have resources for your site (images, sounds, etc)
and you'll need to copy them over to the target too. Such resources should be
placed under 'res' (with the commandline setup) or in your specified +res+
directory, and will be copied directly to the output directory after page
rendering.

Of course, the directory layout beneath +res+ should mirror that of the 
output, and will be preserved during the copy.

== Publishing

Rote does not provide any direct support for publishing your site at present,
relying on you to configure an appropriate publish task if required, using
the publishers supplied with Rake (in rake/contrib). This allows maximum 
flexibility, and allows Rote to concentrate on creating your documents.

The command-line build will automatically look for a file in the top-level
directory (above +doc+) named publish.rf. If found, this file will be 
evaluated by Rake, making any tasks defined within it available to your
build. The most likely use case is to define task that uses an SSH directory
publisher to publish via SCP.

== Final notes

=== Commandline mode

Currently, there isn't enough checking involved on source resources when
building pages from the command-line wrapper - Basically, only templates are
considered when Rake decides what to update. If you change layouts, code or 
resources you'll need to run:
	
	rote clean
		
to make sure everything gets updated. It's recommended to always run upload
as:
	
	rote clean upload
		
Please note that this isn't Rake's limitation - it's mine.	

=== Versioning

Rote uses odd/even numbers for development/release versions. When the final
version component is odd, the package is an 'unofficial' build - generally
this means built manually from source, during development. These will never
be distributed, and there's no guarantee that any two packages with the same
development version will actually be the same. These packages will have no
corresponding CVS tag.

Even numbers always denote 'official' releases, which are released on 
RubyForge and tagged as such in CVS. These packages can be trusted to exhibit
version consistency.

If you are bundling Rote with your product, please ensure you use an official
release version whenever possible. If you must use a developmental version,
please modify the package version to reflect the fact that it is a custom
build (e.g. 0.1.3-mycompany-20051021) to prevent inconsistent development
packages from escaping into the wild.
