= Rote project -- Todo list

Most of the following ideas will probably be implemented at some point.
Send any suggestions or patches (preferably as/with tests) to:

  rosco <at> roscopeco <dot> co <dot> uk

== For 0.3.x
* Plugins, maybe allow pseudo-sections to be created 
  in COMMON.rb, that get their pages from some supplied code.	
  Anything else then stays out of Rote, which is what's needed.	

== For 0.3.x or 0.4
* Ability to have multiple views of a section, e.g. user guide (separate
  pages) and user guide (one page) generated from same source.
* Ability to have standard sets of files (chosen by glob) treated
  as sections and handled in some common way, e.g. apply a
  template and highlighting to a set of Ruby files to make
  a 'source xref' section with appropriate navigation and
  stuff.

== For 1.0
* CSS / XML / etc, maybe with the existing builders (integrated with 
  Format::CSS, Format::XML, so on)  
* As much compatibility between Page and ActionController as poss,
  allowing ActionView helpers to be optionally mixed in.
