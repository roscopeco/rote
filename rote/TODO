= Rote project -- Todo list

Most of the following ideas will probably be implemented at some point.
Send any suggestions or patches (preferably as/with tests) to:

  rosco <at> roscopeco <dot> co <dot> uk

== For 1.0
* CSS / XML / etc, maybe with the existing builders (integrated with 
  Format::CSS, Format::XML, so on)  
* Nested layouts
* Could work as 'plugins', maybe allow pseudo-sections to be created 
   in COMMON.rb, that get their pages from some supplied code.	
   Anything else then stays out of Rote, which is what's needed.	
* Ability to have multiple views of a section, e.g. user guide (separate
  pages) and user guide (one page) generated from same source.
** Maybe in concert with plugins?
* (maybe?) Rant integration
* Macro that evaluates it's body
* Macro/method to run external commands and capture the output.
* Deprecate 'rote' command supporting Rake tasks.
