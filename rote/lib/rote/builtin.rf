#################### CREATE NEW PROJECT FROM TEMPLATE ###############
#
# This works in a slightly odd way. The 'create' task simply sets up
# a rule that catches anything. This rule will then be triggered by
# the task that follows on the command-line, and taken as the 
# target directory name.
# 
# So instead of 'rote create NAME=foo' we have 'rote create foo'
#
# Note that this does preclude having other tasks on the same 
# invocation (after the create at least) but does also allow
# multiple projects to be created at once. 
#
# Also need a way to display error message if the rule isn't 
# invoked at least once...
